# EmbeddingVideoDemo
Android(Java) - Embedding Video Demo

App created in Android Studio 3.5.3 using Java, Android Deployment Target API 19: Android 4.4(KitKat) and tested on a Nexus 5X API 29 Emulator

In this demo app we demonstrate how to code a local Embedded Video Player Demo App.

This demo shows how easy it is to setup a local embedded Video player in an Android app. As soon as the app starts
the video starts to play. Then when you click it, the controls appear at the bottom. The controls allow you to stop, play,
rewind the video and fast forward the video. Along on the bottom to move along the play time line too.
